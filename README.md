# homebrew-crosstools

A collection of bottled cross-compiling toolchains for macOS.

The idea is derived from [SergioBenitez/homebrew-osxct], but the toolchains
here are newer and automatically bottled by CI.

## Installation

With [Homebrew] installed, run:

```
brew install MaterializeInc/crosstools/<toolchain>
```

## Available toolchains

None yet.

## Contributing

PRs that add additional toolchains are encouraged! Use one of the existing
toolchain files as a guide.
