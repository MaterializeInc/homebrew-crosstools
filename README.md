# homebrew-crosstools

A collection of bottled cross-compiling toolchains for macOS and Linux.

The idea is derived from [SergioBenitez/homebrew-osxct], but the toolchains
here are newer and automatically bottled.

## Installation

With [Homebrew] installed, run:

```
brew install benesch/crosstools/<toolchain>
```

## Available toolchains

None yet.

## Contributing

PRs that add additional toolchains are encouraged! Use one of the existing
toolchain files as a guide.
